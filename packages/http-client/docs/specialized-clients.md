# Specialized Clients

Specialized clients provide direct connections with an API. Each method on the client is related to an endpoint in the API.

Right now we have a single Specialized Client, the [Alerts Client](classes/AlertsClient.md) which is a client for the [Alerts API](https://api.alerce.online/alerts/v2).

## Alerts Client

Use the Alerts Client to perform these queries:

- [ fetching a list of objects ](examples/ObjectListQueries.md) based on filters
- [ fetching a single object ]() based on ALeRCE ID
- [ fetching light curve data ]() of a single object (TODO)
- [ fetching magnitude statistics ]() of a single object (TODO)
- [ fetching classification ]() data of a single object (TODO)
- [ fetching crossmatch data ]() of a single object (TODO)

All examples are available in [Examples Page](examples/AlertsClient.md)

## AVRO & Stamps Client
